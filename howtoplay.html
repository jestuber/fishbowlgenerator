<h2 id="fishbowl-game-rules">Fishbowl Game Rules</h1>
<span class="byline">The best cheap party game</span>
</header>

<p>This fun mix of Taboo, Charades, and other games keeps Fishbowl creative, fresh, and hilarious.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-play---fishbowl-materials">Before you Play - Fishbowl Materials</h2>
<p>Fishbowl doesn’t require a lot of materials, but you’ll need a few things:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
<li>6 or more people. (It’s possible to play with four, but more fun with more!)</li>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>A ‘Fishbowl’ of some sort, large mixing bowls work well.</li>
<li>A timer</li>
<li>Enough space for players to act out their cards (like Charades)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use our free <a href="http://fishbowlwords.com/" target="_blank">Fishbowl Card Creator</a> to create your cards. Choose how many players and a level of difficulty. Print out your cards and cut them out. Fold each card in half, and put them all in your Fishbowl.</p>
<!-- <p>PIC OF BOWL WITH CARDS</p>
 -->

<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>Arrange everyone in a circle. Have each person count-off, “One”, “Two”, “One”, “Two”, until everyone is split into two teams.</p>
<!-- <p>DIAGRAM OF PEOPLE SITTING IN A CIRCLE WITH TEAM NUMBER OVER THEIR HEAD</p>
 --><blockquote>
<p>What if we have an odd number of players?
<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
<li>The last person can guess for both teams</li>
<li>The teams can be uneven</li>
<li>The last person can sit out a round :(</li></ul>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fishbowl is played in 3 rounds. Each player has 1 minute to get his/her team to guess words that they pull out of the fishbowl. After 1 minute, the player passes the fishbowl to their left. The fishbowl is passed around the circle until all of the cards have been guessed. Each card that a team successfully guesses is a point, after 3 rounds, the team with the most points wins!</p>

<h2 id="round-1-taboo">Round 1 – Taboo</h2>
<p>In this round, you try to get your team to guess the word without saying the word.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2em;">
<li>Start a 1 minute timer</li>
<li>Grab a card from the fishbowl</li>
<li>Explains what the word is, but be careful! If you say the word on your card, your turn is OVER!</li>
<li>When the team guesses the word correctly, pick another card</li>
<li>When the timer is up, count how many your team got right and pass the fishbowl.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variations of the word are also not allowed. If your word is ‘running’ you can say ‘moving fast with your legs’ but you cannot say ‘run but as a present participle’.</p>
<p>Once all of the cards have been guessed, write down how many words each team guess correctly. Put all the cards back into the fishbowl and get ready for another round!</p>

<h2 id="round-2-charades">Round 2 – Charades</h2>
<p>This round works just like the last one, but now you have to act! Use motions and acting to get your team to guess your word. Remember, you can move as much as you want, but no talking or making sounds is allowed.</p>
<p>Pretend to use your word, act like you are the word, or get creative and use your surrounding objects as props.</p>

<!-- <p>SKETCH OF SOMEONE ACTING CRAZY</p> -->

<h2 id="round-3-one-sound">Round 3 – One Sound</h2>

<p>The last round: One Sound! Get your team to guess the word by making only <em>one</em> noise. Take a few moments to think about which noise you’ll make, because you’ve only got one shot. Bark if your word is ‘dog’, make rocket noises for ‘astronaut’, or be silent for ‘mime’. This round is the hardest, but everyone has seen the cards multiple times. It also produces a lot of laughs!</p>
<h2 id="tally-up-the-score">Tally up the score</h2>
<p>After 3 rounds, the game is over! Count up the scores from all 3 rounds, and congratulate the winning team!</p>
<p><a href="http://fishbowlwords.com/" target="_blank">Print off a new set of cards</a> and play again!</p>
